#### 1.1 Focus Area : 
Sr No. |  Focus Area
:--|:--|
1. | Reinforce theoretical concept
2. | Instrumentation and Practical Skills

#### 1.2 About the Experiment

<br/>1. To teach the basics of Functions using an interactive simulator.
<br/>2. The purpose of the Virtual lab is to create interest in students to conduct new experiments in various disciplines.
<br/>3. With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn different aspects of Python programming language by getting to understand the concepts of Functions.
<br/>4. There might be some users who have a problem of understanding the use of Functions with just the theory in hand. With the simulator, it becomes easy to understand.

#### 1.3 Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr No. |  LO ID |    Learning Objective  | Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| 603 | Student will be able to recall the concepts of Functions in Python programming language. | Recall | Define
2.| 604 | Student will be able to describe the use of Functions in Python programming language. | Understand| Describe
3.| 605 | Student will be able to apply functions in various Python programs. | Apply | Apply

Summative Assessment | 1·  The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learn-ing for the students. The simulation that we provide fullls our purpose <br>2· The learner will be easily able to understand Python programming language.<br>3·  The user will able to understand the use of Functions.<br>4· With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn Python program-ming language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is benecial in understanding the basics of Functions which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation. | Problem Based
